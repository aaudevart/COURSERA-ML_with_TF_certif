# COURSERA-ML_with_TF_certif
MOOC to prepare TF certification


## Part 4 - Sequence & Time Series prediction

### Week 1

Use of statistical method


### Week 2

Use of DNN

Sequence bias is when the order of things can impact the selection of things. 



### Week 3

For this week, we've built on your DNNs with RNNs and LSTMs

LearningRateScheduler

Huber loss function : a loss function used in robust regression, that is less sensitive to outliers in data than the squared error loss.

Clears out all temporary variables that TF might have from previous sessions => tf.keras.backend.clear_session

Defines the dimension index at which you will expand the shape of the tensor => tf.expand_dims

Allowss you to execute arbitrary code while training => Lambda layer
